# The Fable of Gina

## About
This is a game made for [Ludum Dare 35](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/), a 48-hour game jam.

## How to Play
The game is played with the keyboard, and the instructions are onscreen. You can control and play the game with a gamepad too, such as an Xbox 360 Controller, or the [Buffalo Classic USB Gamepad](https://www.amazon.ca/Buffalo-Classic-USB-Gamepad-PC/dp/B002B9XB0E) (which I love).

I've hosted it on my itch.io page [here](https://danbolt.itch.io/the-fable-of-gina), or you can clone and run the game yourself.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser (such as Safari or Firefox)
- Some sort of local web server (protip: `sudo npm install -g http-server`)

## Running
1. Run a web server pointing at the repo's root directory. Then, open a web browser and point to that server.

## I have a question! Something broke!
Feel free to email me.
